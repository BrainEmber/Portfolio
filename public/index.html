      <h3>Mancala</h3>
      <a href="https://brainember.github.io./">Link To Live Site</a>
      <p>Mancala is one of the oldest board-games known to humanity.  It revolves around moving stones around the board and whoever has the most stones at the end wins.  I used HTML, Javascript and css styling to make this app come to life.</p>

      <h3>Starcraft 2 Build Site</h3>
      <a href="https://sc2-builds.herokuapp.com/">Link To Live Site</a>
      <p>Starcraft II is a game that I love to play, I designed this site to store build orders used in the game.  The site functions as a responsive note-taking tool, have it open on your 2nd monitor and you will never be lost in another game of Starcraft.  I used HTMl, Javascript, CSS, ejs partials, jQuery, and MongoDB to construct this site, and Heroku to make the site live.</p>

     <h3>Hicking Planner</h3>
     <a href="https://evening-coast.herokuapp.com/">Link To Live Site</a>
     <p>This website lets you enter information about a hike that you are planning and it will tell you the weather, how much water to drink, and if you should wear any special cloths.  This website was made in collaboration with two other developers.  The team worked extensively with GitHub to make sure that we were all on the same page.  The site was built with HTML, Javascript, CSS, MongoDB, OpenWeather API, Angularjs, jQuery and was made live with Heroku.</p>
